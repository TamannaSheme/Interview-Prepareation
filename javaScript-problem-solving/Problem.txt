##Array Problem Solving
01. Create a function that takes an array containing only numbers and return the first element.
02. Given two arguments, return an array which contains these two arguments.
03.Given an object containing counts of both upvotes and downvotes, return what vote count should be displayed. This is calculated by subtracting the number of downvotes from upvotes.
04. Write a function to reverse an array.
05. You can assign variables from arrays like this:
const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
let a = arr[0]
let b = arr[1]

console.log(a) // outputs 1
console.log(b) // outputs 2
With ES6, you can assign variables from arrays in a much more succinct way. Create variables a and b from the given array using the ES6 destructuring assignment syntax, where a === 1 and b === 2.

10. Create a function that takes two numbers num1, num2, and an array arr and returns an array containing all the numbers in arr greater than num1 and less than num2.
11. Create a function that finds the index of a given item. If the item is not present, return -1.
12. Rotate the Array by One  Given an array, rotate the values clockwise by one (the last value is sent to the first position).
13. Check if an Array Contains a Given Number Write a function to check if an array contains a particular number.
14. Array of Strings to Array of Numbers Create a function that takes as a parameter an array of "stringified" numbers and returns an array of numbers.
